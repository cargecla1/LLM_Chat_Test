# LLM_Chat_Test

The code on the GitHub repository uses the Langchain framework instead of the Rasa framework.

Here is the corrected summary:

The code on the GitHub repository you linked to is a collection of Python scripts that implement a chat bot that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate text. The chat bot is designed to be used with the Langchain framework, and it can be used to have conversations with users on a variety of topics.

The repository includes code for the following components:

A chat bot that uses a LLM to generate text
A Langchain framework that is used to manage the chat bot
A variety of example conversations that show how to use the chat bot
The code is well-documented, and it includes a number of tutorials that show how to use the chat bot. The repository is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning about LLMs or using them in their own projects.

Here is a brief summary of each of the components:

Chat bot: The chat bot is a software that simulates a conversation with a user. The chat bot takes in the user's input and it uses the LLM to generate a response.
Langchain framework: The Langchain framework is a software that is used to manage the chat bot. The framework handles the tasks of understanding the user's input, generating the chat bot's response, and keeping track of the conversation history.
Example conversations: The repository includes a number of example conversations that show how to use the chat bot. The example conversations demonstrate how to have conversations with the chat bot on a variety of topics, such as the weather, sports, and current events.
